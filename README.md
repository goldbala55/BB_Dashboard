Create a web based dynamic dashboard to display bacterial samples

## Project Overview
Create a web site to display a dynamic dashboard for study participants to look up the results of the bacterial samples taken for the study.  Individuals were assigned anonymous numerical ids which can be selected on the page. When selecting different test subject ids the dashboard will update for each choice.  Demographic, cultures found, and cultures per sample are displayed for easy review.

The site uses Bootstrap CSS to make the page responsive and is mobile friendly.
